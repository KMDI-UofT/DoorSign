# DoorSign

This is the website for our door iPad, because we had an older iPad2 we had more limited options in what we could use.  PWAs don't work on it, not that it really matters, and on older Safari there's issues with some images it seems.

## Solutuion we settled on

The sign runs on a freemium app called Kiosk Pro Lite which basically loads a webpage without an address bar.  By putting the iPad in Guided Access mode the tablet is effectively in Kiosk mode.

## Improvements needed

This is the most basic version of the door sign.  I am hoping to engage students to improve upon the code.
